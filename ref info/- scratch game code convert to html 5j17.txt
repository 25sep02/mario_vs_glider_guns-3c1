Converting Scratch game code to HTML can be achieved using online tools designed for this purpose. These tools package your Scratch project into a single HTML file that can be run in a web browser.

Using a Packager Tool:

Choose a Packager: Tools like TurboWarp Packager or Project HTMLifier are commonly used for this conversion.

Access the Project:

Shared Projects: If your Scratch project is shared online, you can copy its Project ID or URL from the Scratch website.

Unshared Projects: If the project is unshared or saved locally, you will need to save the project to your computer as an .sb3 file (File > Save to your computer within Scratch).

Upload or Paste Link: On the chosen packager tool's website, paste the Project ID/URL or upload the .sb3 file.

Configure Options (Optional): Some packagers offer options like enabling turbo mode, setting progress bar colors, or including cloud variables.

Generate HTML: Click the button to initiate the conversion process (e.g., "HTML" or "Package").

Download: The tool will generate and provide a download link for the HTML file containing your Scratch project.

How to download the JavaScript
Short Answer
If you want to package/HTMLify a project, use https://packager.turbowarp.org/
If you want to convert Scratch projects to readable and editable JavaScript, use https://leopardjs.com/ instead of TurboWarp
Long Answer
The code generated by TurboWarp is not designed to be read or edited by humans. Attempting to do so would be actively harmful to one's learning because of the many unusual things done to improve compatibility or performance.

For example, in regular JavaScript accessing a list item is as simple as myList[myIndex], but TurboWarp could do anything from (b1.value[(b0.value | 0) - 1] ?? "") to listGet(b0, b1.value) depending on the context around the list block. b0 and b1 are real variable names that TurboWarp will use and listGet is a part of the TurboWarp runtime, not part of the JavaScript standard. The code also lacks any formatting. Some more code samples are available in another page.

If you want to convert Scratch projects to readable and editable JavaScript, use https://leopardjs.com/

If you really know what you're doing...
Run this in the JavaScript console before starting the project:

vm.enableDebug();

Then the JavaScript will be logged to the console when it gets compiled.

If you don't know what a "JavaScript console" is or how to access it, then it's in your best interest to not look at the generated JavaScript anyways.

Yes, you can convert your Scratch game code to JavaScript using tools like Leopard.JS and HTMLifier. These tools automatically translate your Scratch project into JavaScript, allowing you to edit and run the code in a browser. While automatic conversion is possible, the resulting code may require manual adjustments and might run faster than the original Scratch project.

Leopard.JS: This is a dedicated tool that converts Scratch projects into editable JavaScript code. It allows you to load a project from a link and gives you a JavaScript editor that looks like Scratch, making it easier to transition.

HTMLifier: This tool converts Scratch projects into a package that can be run in a browser. It's more geared towards running the project as a playable web page rather than providing editable JavaScript code for manual editing, unlike Leopard.

How to use them

Load your project: Open the tool's website and either paste a link to your Scratch project or upload the .sb3 file.

Convert to code: Click the "convert" or "edit" button. The tool will generate the JavaScript code based on your project's blocks.

Edit and run: You can now edit the generated JavaScript code in the provided editor or download the code to run it locally.

Things to consider

Speed: The converted project may run faster than the original Scratch project because it runs on the browser's native JavaScript engine instead of the Scratch interpreter.

Complexity: While the tools automate the conversion, some complex Scratch features might not translate perfectly. You may need to manually adjust the code to fix any issues.

Learning curve: If you're new to JavaScript, tools like Leopard that provide a Scratch-like editor can be a good way to learn.
