The game has a user controlled Mario character and two user controlled "gosper glider guns" that shoot exploding "gliders" to the ground. The gliders and glider guns were animated from frame sequences copied directly for "Conway's Game of Life", an old and well known "cellular automata" "0 players video game" originally published in the old print magazine Scientific American in 1970.

Github upload for my project in folder: "vsc webdev\main\-j1; scratch js-games turbowarp-dhtml - 3mg"

The original project was made in March 2023 using the Scratch MIT game engine and its custom scripting development environment 'studio'.

Using the freeware 'Turbo Warp' studio app provided better studio features, and allowed exporting the project in DHTML format that can be run in a browser from a direct url link (web server link).

The original project and related content is stored in my Scratch game engine content collection.
